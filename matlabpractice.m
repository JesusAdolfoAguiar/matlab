% The function takes the voltage difference V (in volts) applied to a cyclotron
% as input. The cyclotron is a device that accelerates subatomic particles
% (deuterons) between two “D”-shaped vacuum chambers, alternating the sign
% of V between such chambers. The function returns the energy E of the deuteron
% when it escapes the cyclotron in units of million electron volts (MeV),
% and the number n of times the deuteron enters the Ds.

% The particle moves as follows:
% -It originates at a distance s0 to the left center of the cyclotron, is
% accelerated vertically into the upper D, and then moves in a semicircle of
% radius r1 in a clockwise direction. The deuteron is accelerated only as it
% is leaving one D an entering the other, moving at constant speed while
% inside a D.
% -It leaves the upper D and is accelerated vertically downward into the lower
% D where moves with a larger radius r2.
% -It leaves the lower D and is accelerated vertically into the upper D, and so
% on.
%
% It moves with ever increasing radii rn until (N) it repeats the same process
% for the last time and exits the lower D in the left side. The calculation of
% radii (in meters) is based on:
%
% r1 = (mV/(qB^2))^(1/2)
% m = deuteron mass = 3.344*10^(-27) kg
% q = (r^2(n-1)+2mV/(qB^2))^(1/2)
% s0 = r1/2
%
% The deuteron escapes through a window at the left that is placed so the
% particle can not leave until is more than 0.500 m to the left of the cyclotron.
% There is no gap between the Ds.
